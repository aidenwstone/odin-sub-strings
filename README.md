# odin-sub-strings
This is a simple program created as part of The Odin Project. I will use the Ruby basics I have learned so far to code a program which will take a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. It will return a hash listing each substring that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
